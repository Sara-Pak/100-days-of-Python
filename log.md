# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: created a team name generator. this required input from the user and displaying the data recieved from user. Attempting to make a habit on defining class types when defining variables.

**Thoughts:** Spent too much setting up git due to issues with branch merges between github and IDE. Decided to delete project and create project + github project from the IDE.

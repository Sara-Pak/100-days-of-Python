# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: January 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created a validator for passwords. The program will validate the password that I've made up to be either validated or not in regards to the restrictions or rules on creating a password. Such as the password must contain one upper case letter.

**Thoughts:** This is not exactly how I wanted to create this program. I originally wanted to create a method that would validate the user's input of the password and respond whether or not the password is validated. Perhaps even add another step into specifying what would validate the password. I will have more time tomorrow to possible create another program that would combine these last 2 days, including the additional suggestions I've mentioned.

### Day 2: January 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created a password generator that allows the user to determine how many characters, numbers, and special characters used in the password generator.

**Thoughts:** Though I was able to complete this small project within the hour, I wanted to do more with it. Such as creating rules as most passwords required at least 1 capital letter, number, symbol, and defining a minimum number of characters for the password. Perhaps, I can try to implement it tomorrow. Going to read and continue with python course for the remainder of the night.

### Day 1: January 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: created a team name generator. this required input from the user and displaying the data recieved from user. Attempting to make a habit on defining class types when defining variables.

**Thoughts:** Spent too much setting up git due to issues with branch merges between github and IDE. Decided to delete project and create project + github project from the IDE.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created a password generator that allows the user to determine how many characters, numbers, and special characters used in the password generator.

**Thoughts:** Though I was able to complete this small project within the hour, I wanted to do more with it. Such as creating rules as most passwords required at least 1 capital letter, number, symbol, and defining a minimum number of characters for the password. Perhaps, I can try to implement it tomorrow. Going to read and continue with python course for the remainder of the night.

### Day 1: January 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: created a team name generator. this required input from the user and displaying the data recieved from user. Attempting to make a habit on defining class types when defining variables.

**Thoughts:** Spent too much setting up git due to issues with branch merges between github and IDE. Decided to delete project and create project + github project from the IDE.

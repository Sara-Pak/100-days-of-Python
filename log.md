# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 8: January 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I never finished day 8 on converting a YouTube video into a MP3. Today, I've learned that the path was not set in the output of the mp3 file. After correcting this, my program worked perfectly. 

**Thoughts:** I didn't think starting a daily challenge during the cold seasons I would be too sick or lethargic to code but it that was a challenge of its own. I am about a week behind in this challenge but better late than never.

### Day 6: January 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today, I created a function that allows the user to send an email. It is still a working progress.

**Thoughts:** realizing the challenges of coding a solid hour each day in addition to working 10=hr shift and taking Google python course. Though, I may not have the energy by the end of the day. I am trying to stay committed.

### Day 5: January 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today, I created a converter that takes a pdf into mp3. I decided to follow a tutorial today, however, the code is not fully correct in the sense that it will only convert a single page into an audio form as there is no use of concatenation if there are more than one page.

**Thoughts:** I am not sure how useful this program is but wanted to learn something relatively easily and new at the same time.

### Day 4: January 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Tonight,  I created a calulator that specifically calculates how many cans of paint would cover at the given input by the user. 

**Thoughts:** Today I am physically exhausted from work today, that I literally was struggling to keep awake and forgot numerous times that there was a hot cup of tea waiting for me for this reason. Days like this is challenging to keep a sharp mind in programming and perhaps on days like this to at least follow a new tutorial, something that may learn something and change things up than the norm.

### Day 3: January 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created a validator for passwords. The program will validate the password that I've made up to be either validated or not in regards to the restrictions or rules on creating a password. Such as the password must contain one upper case letter.

**Thoughts:** This is not exactly how I wanted to create this program. I originally wanted to create a method that would validate the user's input of the password and respond whether or not the password is validated. Perhaps even add another step into specifying what would validate the password. I will have more time tomorrow to possible create another program that would combine these last 2 days, including the additional suggestions I've mentioned.

### Day 2: January 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created a password generator that allows the user to determine how many characters, numbers, and special characters used in the password generator.

**Thoughts:** Though I was able to complete this small project within the hour, I wanted to do more with it. Such as creating rules as most passwords required at least 1 capital letter, number, symbol, and defining a minimum number of characters for the password. Perhaps, I can try to implement it tomorrow. Going to read and continue with python course for the remainder of the night.

### Day 1: January 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: created a team name generator. this required input from the user and displaying the data recieved from user. Attempting to make a habit on defining class types when defining variables.

**Thoughts:** Spent too much setting up git due to issues with branch merges between github and IDE. Decided to delete project and create project + github project from the IDE.
